## Background

Infectious diseases continue to pose a major threat to human health on a global scale. The current COVID-19 pandemic and other recent outbreaks such as SARS (2002) and Ebola (2013) highlight the immense burden they can impose on society. Statistical models have been established as an essential tool for understanding the outbreak of epidemics and their transmission dynamics. Such an understanding can be used to inform public policy and control strategies with the goal of mitigating the worst effects of infectious diseases and epidemics.
